[libiptc](http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Querying-libiptc-HOWTO/whatis.html) bindings for Go language.
Object-oriented design, support for IPv6 (libip6tc) and same wait locking mechanism as iptables/ip6tables official binaries.

This project currently contains Go bindings to libip4tc/libip6tc dynamic link libraries, most headers/commenst are from original [iptables](http://www.netfilter.org/) C headers.

Please note that there is no public/stable C/C++ API for libiptc, quoting from official [Netfilter FAQs](http://www.netfilter.org/documentation/FAQ/netfilter-faq-4.html#ss4.5):

> 4.5 Is there an C/C++ API for adding/removing rules?
>
> The answer unfortunately is: No.
>
> Now you might think 'but what about libiptc?'. As has been pointed out numerous times on the mailinglist(s), libiptc was _NEVER_ meant to be used as a public interface. We don't guarantee a stable interface, and it is planned to remove it in the next incarnation of linux packet filtering. libiptc is way too low-layer to be used reasonably anyway.
>
> We are well aware that there is a fundamental lack for such an API, and we are working on improving that situation. Until then, it is recommended to either use system() or open a pipe into stdin of iptables-restore. The latter will give you a way better performance.

# How to use

Install the dependency with `go get` or your dependency system of choice.
```
go get github.com/nnnewb/go-libiptc
```

You can use xtables locking features by importing `github.com/nnnewb/go-libiptc` and IPv4/IPv6 features by importing either `github.com/nnnewb/go-libiptc/ipv4` or `github.com/nnnewb/go-libiptc/ipv6`.

Once the package is imported and being used, the OS thread is locked to a specific background goroutine and all calls are performed serially through such goroutine.

# Building

In order to build this package it is necessary for it to reside within a proper GOPATH and that iptables headers are globally available on the system; on Debian/Ubuntu systems these are provided by `iptables-dev` package, otherwise you can refer to the official upstream iptables git repository: `git://git.netfilter.org/iptables.git`.

To build everything (except tests):
```
make
```

To build the package it will suffice a:
```
make build
```

To run tests (with proper root privileges):
```
make test
```

To build the examples:
```
make examples
```

# TODO

* ~~separate libip6tc package that uses '#cgo LDFLAGS: -lip6tc'~~
* unit tests coverage
* finally, some analysis of memory leakage
